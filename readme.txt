Implements the Font Awesome icon font in WordPress through shortcodes.

== Description ==

###Just The Shortcodes, Please
Plenty of great WordPress plugins focus on providing or including the Font Awesome library into your site. Font Awesome Shortcodes for WordPress assumes you're working with a theme that already includes Font Awesome 4 and focuses on giving you a great set of shortcodes to use it with.

This plugin creates a simple, out of the way button just above the WordPress TinyMCE editor (next to the "Add Media" button) which pops up a handy icon-selector, and the plugin's documentation with shortcode examples for reference and handy "Insert Example" links to send the example shortcodes straight to the editor. There are no additional TinyMCE buttons to clutter up your screen, just great, easy to use shortcodes!

####Updated for Font Awesome 4.1!
Now supporting all of the new icons and aliases added in Font Awesome 4.1 and a slick new icon-picker to choose them with!

== Changelog ==

= 4.1.2 = 
* Fix display problem where the Font Awesome Shortcodes help modal was appearing on pages it shouldn't

= 4.1 =
* This release features a brand new, much easier to use popup for the documentation. We're now using Bootstrap's "modal" component rather than the soon-to-be-retired WordPress Thickbox. We've also split the documentation up into tabs so that the technical information about the plugin isn't cluttering up the shortcode reference material. This should make the plugin a little less scary for end-users.
